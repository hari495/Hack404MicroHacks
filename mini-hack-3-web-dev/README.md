# Mini Hack 3 - Flask Dashboard Microhack

As part of the microhack 5, we designed a webpage using python Flask and HTML, particularly the dashboard page of the hacker website.
To continue our work, we added CSS to the file to make it appear more stylish, adding a blue/green colour theme throughout the website to make it more "hacker-like"
